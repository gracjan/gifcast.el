Create screencasts of Emacs from coded scenarios
================================================

Create screencasts of Emacs sessions from coded scenarios.
Write scenario in Emacs Lisp.

Example
-------

This animation:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gracjan/gifcast.el/master/hello-world.gif" width="294" height="182">

Was generated by this code:

```elisp

(require 'gifcast)

(gifcast-animation
 hello-world
 (set-frame-size (window-frame (get-buffer-window)) 40 10)
 (progn
   (when (get-buffer "file.txt")
     (kill-buffer "file.txt"))
   (switch-to-buffer (get-buffer-create "file.txt"))
   (delete-other-windows)

   (insert (concat
            "The greeting is:\n"
            "\n"
            "    Hello ")))
 (gifcast-capture)
 (gifcast-keys "W")
 (gifcast-capture)
 (gifcast-keys "o")
 (gifcast-capture)
 (gifcast-keys "r")
 (gifcast-capture)
 (gifcast-keys "l")
 (gifcast-capture)
 (gifcast-keys "d")
 (gifcast-capture)
 (gifcast-keys "!")
 (gifcast-capture)
 (gifcast-generate "hello-world.gif")

 (kill-buffer "file.txt")
 nil)

```

by running:


```
$EMACS -q -L . -l example.el -f gifcast-generate-batch-and-exit
```

Documentation
-------------

- `gifcast-animation name body`

   A macro to declare animation named NAME. BODY is a list of form. Note that although body looks
   like a function definition in reality each of the top level forms will be executed asynchronously from
   a timer. This is done so that Emacs can react to user input and redraw the screen.
   Only top level forms are executed separately.
   
- `gifcast-animation-0`

  Delare animation as disabled so that neither `gifcast-generate-batch` nor `gifcast-generate-batch-and-exit` executes it.
  
- `gifcast-keys`

  Add keys to processing queue to simulate user input events. For example `(gifcast-keys "Abc")` simulates a user entering
  <kbd>A</kbd> then <kbd>b</kbd> then <kbd>c</kbd>. `(gifcast-keys (kbd "RET")` simulates a <kbd>RET</kbd>.

- `gifcast-capture`

  Capture current Emacs window as next animation frame. Optional parameter DURATION says how much time should this frame last
  in milisecons, defaults to 100ms.
  
- `gifcast-generate`

  Generate final animated GIF and save it to the path given as parameter.
  
- `gifcast-generate-batch`

  Function to be called from command line to generate a set of animations. Usage:
  
      $EMACS -q -L . -l example.el -f gifcast-generate-batch
  
  Use full for debugging purposes because Emacs stays open after animations have run. For fully automated
  animation generation use `gifcast-generate-batch-and-exit`.
  
- `gifcast-generate-batch-and-exit`
  
  Function to be called from command line to generate a set of animations. Usage:
  
      $EMACS -q -L . -l example.el -f gifcast-generate-batch-and-exit
  

Requirements
------------

- Mac OS X
- Emacs that runs in GUI mode under Mac OS X (Aquamacs, Emacs)
- `/usr/sbin/screencapture` -- comes with Mac OS X
- `convert` from ImageMagic or GraphicsMagick
